## Text Emotion Detection

Emotion Detection and Recognition from text is a recent field of research 
that is closely related to Sentiment Analysis and it aims to detect and recognize 
types of feelings through the expression of texts, such as anger, disgust, fear, 
happiness, sadness, and surprise. Emotion detection may have useful 
applications such as “Gauging how happy our citizens are”.








## Language 

 Python

## Installation

The Code is written in Python 3.7. If you don't have Python installed go to Python website and install it. If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip.

```bash
  pip install tensorflow
  pip install numpy
  
```

## Conclusion
The model gets trained and implemented for finding the emotion from the given text using machine learning algorithm.

## Future Enhancement
Need to use other effecient alogorithm for better detection.
